# Biometric-Systems-Using-Neural-Signals
This project explores Neural Biometrics using EEG, EOG, and sEMG signals for secure authentication. Traditional methods like passwords and fingerprints are vulnerable, but neural signals offer a Unique, non-replicable alternative. Using Machine Learning (Random Forest), high-security authentication is achieved.
