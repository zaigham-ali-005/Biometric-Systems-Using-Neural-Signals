# **Biometric Systems Using Neural Signals** 🧠🧬

## **Introduction**  
Traditional authentication methods like passwords and fingerprints are increasingly vulnerable to security threats. This project explores **neural biometrics**, leveraging **EEG (Electroencephalography), EOG (Electrooculography), and sEMG (Surface Electromyography)** signals to develop a **secure and non-replicable authentication system**.  

## **Project Overview**  
Using neural signals, we implemented **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to classify users based on their unique biometric patterns. The model was trained on **data from 300 individuals**, achieving an accuracy of **85-93% (EEG) and 80-91% (EOG & sEMG)**.  

## **Key Features**  
✔ **Multimodal Biometric Authentication** – Uses EEG, EOG, and sEMG for enhanced security  
✔ **Machine Learning-Based Classification** – Trained with the Random Forest algorithm  
✔ **High Accuracy & Reliability** – Secure against spoofing or hacking  
✔ **Non-Intrusive & Contactless** – Ideal for high-security environments  

## **Methodology**  
1. **Data Collection** – EEG, EOG, and sEMG signals recorded under controlled conditions  
2. **Preprocessing** – Signal filtering, feature extraction, and normalization  
3. **Machine Learning** – Random Forest model trained on neural biometric data  
4. **Evaluation** – Model performance assessed using accuracy, precision, and recall  

## **Applications**  
🔹 **High-Security Access Control** – Government, banking, and personal devices  
🔹 **Brain-Computer Interfaces** – Smart machine control using neural signals  
🔹 **Healthcare & Neurological Monitoring** – Personalized authentication in medical systems  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- **Deep Learning Integration** to improve accuracy (up to 99%)  
- **Wearable Device Compatibility** for real-world applications  
- **Advanced Privacy & Security Measures** for ethical data usage
